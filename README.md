Power Line Aerial Image Restoration under Adverse Weather: Datasets and Baselines

Power Line Autonomous Inspection (PLAI) plays a
crucial role in the construction of smart grid due to its great advantages of low cost, high efficiency and safe operation. PLAI is completed by accurately detecting the electrical components
and defects in the aerial images captured by UAVs or helicopters. However, visible quality of aerial images are inevitably degraded by the adverse weather like haze, rain or snow, which is found
to drastically decrease the detection accuracy in our research. To circumvent this problem, we propose a new task of Power Line Aerial Image Restoration under Adverse Weather (PLAIR-
AW), which aims to recover clean and high-quality images from degraded images with bad weather thus improving detection performance for PLAI. In this context, we are the first to
release numerous corresponding datasets, which are synthesized upon the public power line aerial image datasets of CPLID, TTPLA, InsPLAD following the mathematical models, namely,
HazeCPLID, HazeTTPLA, HazeInsPLAD for dehazing, RainC-PLID, RainTTPLA, RainInsPLAD for deraining, SnowCPLID,SnowInsPLAD for desnowing. Meanwhile, we select the state-of-the-art methods from image restoration community as the
baseline methods for PLAIR. At last, we conduct large-scale empirical experiments to evaluate the performance of baseline methods on the proposed datasetsã€‚
